## Node/Postgres to Firebase Script 💾

🔹 A simple script to allow the retrieval of a database built with NodeJS/PostgreSQL and 
subsequently populate a Firebase database with the same data. 

🔹 Created to solve a small issue with a project that has slow retrieval times on Heroku's
Postgres service as it receives very few requests. Firebase should allow for a speedier
and more consistent retrieval time. 

🔹 Scripts are annotated for future reference or for anybody who would like to achieve a similar
result.
